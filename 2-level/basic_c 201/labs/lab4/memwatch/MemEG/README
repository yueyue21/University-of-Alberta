Has one file (memEG.c) and a Makefile (and this README) which help
illustrate how to use MEMWATCH.

Note
  - memwatch.c and memwatch.h need to be downloaded into the same
    directory
  - in memEG.c, uncomment inclusion of memwatch.h
  - in Makefile uncomment text to compile and link MEMWATCH 
  - in Makefile, uncomment -D MEMWATCH flags.

Once done, type

  make

to compile (a warning about an unused variable is expected) and

  ./memEG

to run.
