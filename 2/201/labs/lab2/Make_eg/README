Use as sample code for Makefile presentation, and to illustrate the
math needed for asn1.  (Style here is not correct.)

Files:  Makefile, draw0.c, draw0.h

Need sketchpad.jar (from Assignment 1 page) in working directory.

Compile:  make
Run:      ./draw0

See comments in draw0.c for what to enter.
