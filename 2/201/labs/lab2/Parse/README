Does the following (see parse.c comment for more details)

  Read from input file (1st col.)             Convert to this (2nd col.)
  ==============================              =========================
  various forms of CLEARScreen                clearScreen
  various forms of Pause n                    pause n_r
  various forms of END                        end
  various forms of DRAWSegment x1 y1 x2 y2    drawSegment x1_r y1_r x2_r y2_r

  Also rounds the number parameters to drawSegment to all long.

Compile by typing make.

Ensure an executable sketchpad.jar in the current directory, and run by
typing

./parse ./input_file

where input_file is a text file containg valid input for parse.c.

I did not collaborate with anyone.
