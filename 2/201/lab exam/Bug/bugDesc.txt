		if(p->next == NULL)
			tail = p->prev;
		else
			p->next->prev = p->prev;
the bug is we need put "p->next->prev = p->prev;" into an else where the condition 
is p->next is NOT a NULL.that is , if p's next is not NULL thus it is not the last
item in the d-list. therefore,to delete this item, we need to link the p'next item
by p's previous item.
