History 

Version 3.2 2009-01-03
    - fixed detection of case where lander is close to terrain y boundary, in 
    which case the lander is prevented from any further off screen motion in y.
    This was preventing landing on terrain close to the bottom of the screen.

Version 3.1 2008-11-23
    - fixed the restart key by removing any scheduled simulation time step
    events, and then initializing
    - modified GetTerrainInfo to handle situations where there is no terrain 
    below the lander, will return the empty list.
    - improved the sticking at the boundary of the simulation space.  Now
    sticks at top and bottom and sets y velocity and acceleration to 0
    - improved slope handling, compute the terrain slope only once

Version 3.0 2008-11-22
    - Complete rewrite to use Tkx.  
    - Do not delete and redraw lander every time, just modify the existing
    graphics object
    - Got rid of local clipping routines and use overlap detection 
    features of Tcl/Tk
    - still need to fix the restart key causing multple scheduling of update 
    time step events when lander is flying, this causes time to speed up!


Version 2.2 2008-10-29
    - added new methods to lander.pl
    main::GetSpaceBoundaries() 
    main::GetLanderDimensions()
    main::GetGravity()
    main::GetEngineThrust()
    main::GetTime()
    - added new methods to AutoPilot.pm
    AutoPilot::Initialize()
    AutoPilot::On()
    AutoPilot::Off()
    - fixed bug in lander.pl that was reporting incorrect line segment
    number on landing and crash.  Also added additional line segment 
    information.

Version 2.1 2008-10-28  
lander.pl
    - added -d debug option to set lander.pl debug flag
    - added -D debug option to set autopilot debug flag, and
    main::GetAutopilotDebug() to obtain the flag
    - added -p pause delay to allow setting pause time between simulation 
      steps to speed up or slow down time.
    - fixed an error in the position information for the lander.  The lander
      image is now properly centered over the actual position
AUtoPilot.pm
    - added info about lander dimensions 
    - new call main::GetAutopilotDebug to fetch -D option to make autopilot
    debugging easier.

Version 2.0 2009-10-21 - converted from Tk to Tkx so will run under Active State
    Perl 5.8 and 5.10

Version 1.7 2009-10-28 - back updated additions to Version 2.1, will not
    support version 1.x any further.  Changes to AutoPilot.pm and lander.pl

Version 1.6 2008-09-09 - added -T option to load a terrain description. 
Cleaned up some of the terrain code wrt naming conventions.

Version 1.5 2007-10-18 - added documentation in help for the -l command 
line option.

Version 1.4 2007-10-17 - added the -l x command line option to set x as the
target landing zone x-coordinate so that the autopilot knows where to go.
It can obtain this information by calling: main::GetTargetLandingZoneX()

Version 1.3 2007-10-17 - fixed bug in physics (acceleration term was wrong), 
explicity mention delta_t in the physics tersm, delta_t = 1 sec.  Added example
of how to keep track of information over calls to DoLanding.

Version 1.2 2007-10-16 - fixed bug in rotate lander that was doing rotations 
in 3 degree increments instead of 1.

Version 1.1 2007-10-15 - official release with comments on AutoPilot.pm 
module interface.

Version 1.0 2007-10-13 - preliminary release for keeners.
