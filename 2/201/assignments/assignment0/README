=============================================
Personal statement:
1.
the code could filt all stuff inside a "< >"
but can not do a input for "<hello1<hello2>hello3>"
the output for the input above is "hello3>".
2.
if you want a blank line between each lined context
you can enable the with /**/ or //
3.
there are 4 instructions in makefile:
make: compile the program
make show: show the text in both files(you need to output the output file before you show it.)
make output: create a new txt file contain the filtered text
make clean: remove the output file and the compiled file
