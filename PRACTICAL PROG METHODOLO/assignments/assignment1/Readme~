====================================================================================================================
Personal statement:
1.
the compiled program alway at argv[0]
the program is generally dealing with 4 cases:
	case1:	no -f or -l, argc == 2, 	fixed position.
	case2:	have -f but no -l, argc == 4, 	there are two subcases.positions for the special term
	case3:	have -l but no -f, argc == 3, 	fixed position.
	case4:	have -f and -l, argc == 5,	there are two subcases.
the program first find the -f and -l if possible, so that we can have the position of the file position if possible.
then open the files if possible:
	in terms of -l file, I created an array term[][] to store all the terms 
2.
the makefile contains:
	make
	make clean
	make output1- output5
