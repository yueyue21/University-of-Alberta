This briefly describes how we marked your asn3.

input and output files, and the TestStack and TestQueue classes are in
asn3_marking_files.zip.

Most output compared in part using diff -b.

Part 1

  Ran TestStack (which calls your IntegerStack).  Compared output to
  correct output, which is in

    output.1.1.testStack.txt

  Also ran RPN on 2 expressions

    3 9 6 - +                 (in input.1.2.1.like_online.txt
                               correct output in output.1.2.1.like_online.txt)

    23 4 - 9 5 4 + + + 10 -   (in input.1.2.2.harder.txt
                               correct output in output.1.2.2.harder.txt)

Part 2

  Ran TestQueue (which calls your WaitingArea).  Compared output to
  correct output, which is in

    output.2.3.testQueue.txt

  (Also ran PassportControl twice.  Output just needed to look correct.)
