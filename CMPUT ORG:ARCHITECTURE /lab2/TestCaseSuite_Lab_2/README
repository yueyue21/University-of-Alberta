CMPUT 229 - README File for test cases for Lab 2 
================================================


1. Disclaimer: this files are provided "as-is" for your convenience,
and they are not an exhaustive set of tests for your program (i.e. if
your code passes all tests it does not imply you will get full marks). 
This is provided as additional support material for your assignment
and you are ultimately responsible for using it correctly.

These test cases only work on Linux (with spim 8.0).  

2. Contents:

	- Folder "tests": contains the test case. For each test case
	there is three files: *.s (the actual instructions), *.bin 
	and *.out (expected output created by using your code with
	common.s).
	- Several bash scripts (we talk about those below).
	- common.s (Testing harness).

3. Usage 

- Pre-requirements:
	* spim 8.0
	* A bash console.

- To use the existing set of tests:  

	a) Copy your subroutine code in a separate file in the same
	folder as the rest of the scripts. 

	b) Run "sh runAllTests.sh <name_of_your_file>". 

	c) If all the three tests cases pass, you will see something
	like this:

Running tests on solution.s
testcase1.bin : Passed
testcase2.bin : Passed
testcase3.bin : Passed

	If not, you will get a "diff" screen comparing the expected output
	file vs the actual output. For more information on how diff works,
	type "man diff" in the console. 

4. Troubleshooting

	If spim hangs after running a script, you can stop the execution
	using "sh stopHang.sh" on the same or in another terminal. 
	Note that using "killall spim" is as effective.
