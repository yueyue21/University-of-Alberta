This a sample result might differs from mechine to mechine,or the case that you 
uncomment part of the code.
here it goes:
the very beginning of the memory always neither readable or writeable
0x8048000         8192            0       /*text*/  
0x804a000         4096            1       /*data(initialized & un initialized)*/ 
0x9d12000         135168          1      /*heap, a readable big range*/   
0xf75ce000        4096            1       /*  
0xf75cf000        1728512         0         library
0xf7775000        16384           1         
0xf77ab000        8192            1         
0xf77ad000        139264          0       
0xf77cf000        4096            1         */
0xff850000        139264          1 	 /*stack*/



	The chunk of 0xff850000 must the stack, since the location of it is 
quite high.also it can be modified and load, which agrees to the fact that it
contains some variables, or prameters. But unfortunately, we can not know such 
variables are local ones or globle ones only by the test we implemented. 

	In terms of first 2 chunks, they are known as continer of text, which 
can be some excutable items. Such areas contains the bss segment and text segment

	The chunk of 0x9d12000 is obviousely larger than the previous two chunks.
which can be used to allocate a dynamic storage

	The rest of the memory contains library functions(can not know only buy
the test we implemented). Some of them are read only while some can be modified
